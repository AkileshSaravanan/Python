#Array
#An Array is basically a data structure which can hold more than one value at a time.
#It is collection or ordered series of elements of the same type.

#Difference between Array and List
#Both Array and List stores a same way of storing data.
#Both are mutuable.
#Array take only single data type elements(Eg: int only, float only...)
#List can have any type of data (Eg : int,float,String..)
#Operations like slicing and looping are similar for both
#But for different operation like  if we want to multiply our array by 2,divide by 2 in array is possible
#But in list it is not possible it will throw error because naturally you cannot multiply String or divide by them

#Creation of array
# in python can be created after importing the array module

#importing array module by three ways
#1. import array(without alias)
#2. import array as arr(using alias)(It is most used method)
#3. from array import* (using *)

#Accessing a array elements
#Access elements using index values
#Indexing starts from 0 and not from 1.Hence the index number is always 1 less than the length of the array.
#Negative indexing values can be used as well as. It starts from the reversal order of traversal i.e from right o left

#Operations
#Finding the length of an array
#Adding / Changing elements of an array
#Removing / Deleting elements an array
#Array concatenation
#Slicing
#Looping through an Array
