The program should get the branding expenses, travel expenses, food expenses, and logistics expenses as input from the user and calculate the total expenses for an event and the percentage rate of each of these expenses.

Input format :
The first input is a double value that corresponds to the branding expenses.
The second input is a double value that corresponds to the travel expenses.
The third input is a double value that corresponds to the food expenses.
The fourth input is a double value that corresponds to the logistics expenses.

Output format :
The first line of the output should display the double value that corresponds to the total expenses for the Event.
The next four lines should display the percentage rate of each of the expenses.

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
