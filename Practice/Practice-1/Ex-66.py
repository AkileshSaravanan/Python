'''
In the previous problem, we had 
ï¿½
t test cases and each test case had 1 line of input.
However, each test case can have multiple lines of input as well.

Task
Lets write a program in the IDE which performs the following

The 1st line of input is an integer t - the count of test cases
Each test case consists of 2 lines of input
The 1st line of input has 2 space separated integers - accept them as variables A and B
The 2nd line of input has 3 space separated integers - accept them as variables C, D and E
For each test case - output all integers on a single line
Sample 1:
Input
3
1 2
3 4 5
11 22
33 44 55
1 23
456 789 101112
Output
1 2 3 4 5
11 22 33 44 55
1 23 456 789 101112
